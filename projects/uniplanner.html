                            <strong>Uniplanner</strong> is a <em>Student Planner and Team Collaboration Web Application</em> developed for my dissertation project.
                            The website goal is to simplify the life of a university student by offering, in one application, a set of features in which the user can keep track of his course in a more efficient manner.

                    <p>
                        I decided to build this application because as a final-year university student I came to the conclusion that I was using a range of different applications to keep track of my lectures and collaborate with my colleagues. I thought then that by building a fully responsive website which will address a variety of academic needs I could solve this problem.
                        The base of the application needed to be a solid one and numerous factors had to be considered before actually start the first designs. As I knew that patience may not be the right word to describe a university student I aimed to develop an application which is simple, easy-to-use but in the same way complete in terms of features.
                        After researching various similar applications I started working on the application branding and chose the base colours as well as designing the logo.
                    </p>

                            #FF4081

                        <div class="design-colours__item" style="background-color: #F5F5F5; color: #343434">
                            #F5F5F5

                    <p>
                         When I felt that the application values were in the right place I designed the wireframes which were updated in accordance with the usability tests I've carried out on my university colleagues. I learnt in this way that all of us expect an application in which we are guided through by the user interface elements we are mostly used to.
                         Below you can find a few examples of the designed wireframes.

                        In my research process of similar applications, I also studied the underpinning technology in order to make the best decision for what I'll use. Starting with the back-end, the "classic" debate then ignited, Node.js vs. PHP. Without going into details of pros and cons, I can say that that battle was won by PHP mostly because, realistically, I didn't feel prepared enough at that time with Node.js (the war is not over). Moving on to the front-end, I opted for JavaScript (jQuery) which was used mostly to render the pages with content, make asynchronous requests or create dynamic elements. The base of the styling was set using the Material Design Lite framework and a touch of my own CSS.

                         In April 2018, after approximately four months of designing and development, the web application was set live
                         (available at <a class="normal-link" title="http://uniplanner.co.uk" href="http://uniplanner.co.uk">www.uniplanner.co.uk</a>).
                         The website offers a number of features and my best recommendation would be to access it using a testing account and play around with the various features (e.g. creating modules, lectures, notes, tasks, groups, .etc)
                         in order to gather a better understanding of how it works.

                         I can state that building Uniplanner was a challenge. A challenge which offered me huge satisfaction for the reason that I learned a lot from it. From research to evaluation, every process played its part and every mistake was there to settle in my memory... and haunt me cause I didn't spot it earlier.
                        <br/><br/>
                         The application is far from perfect and has space for numerous improvements which will probably be considered in the future. At this point, by my estimation, the application achieved the proposed objectives and it can be successfully used by a university student to keep track of his course. However, it wasn't yet promoted for the reason that there still small sections which are unfinished (e.g. Blog, Footer).

                        If you would like to know more regarding the process of building this application please don't hesitate to contact me.
